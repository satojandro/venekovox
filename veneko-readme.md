# VenekoVox

**Build from exile. Speak with dignity. Govern with truth.**

VenekoVox is not just a hackathon project. It is a movement.
A privacy-first, civic-native protocol to empower real people in Latin America and beyond to have their voices heard ‚Äî securely, anonymously, and with verifiable legitimacy.

Born out of the Aleph Hackathon, built across Colombia and the diaspora, VenekoVox is a prototype for a decentralized, community-driven polling platform. One that respects individual identity, invites global participation, and remains tamper-proof and censorship-resistant.

## üåé Vision

From Caracas to Cali, Buenos Aires to Bogot√° ‚Äî millions of citizens have lived through decades of political violence, disenfranchisement, and eroding trust in institutions. Yet, their opinions remain underrepresented and their dignity, unheard.

VenekoVox aims to change that ‚Äî by building the infrastructure to:

* **Verify identity without revealing it.** Using Self.xyz's zk-based identity verification, we prove geographic and demographic eligibility.
* **Protect voices, not expose them.** Leveraging MACI + Semaphore for anonymous, verifiable, sybil-resistant voting.
* **Make public sentiment a public good.** Results are auditable, stored immutably (potential Filecoin integration), and visualized beautifully.

## üß† What We're Building

* A bilingual (English + Spanish) web-first platform, mobile-friendly, built for usability and virality.
* Polls categorized by geography and theme ‚Äî from political proposals to cultural debates.
* An onboarding experience rooted in ritual: the "Trust Ceremony" to verify and anonymize identity.
* A public dashboard of poll results, segmented (optionally) by age/gender groupings (never disclosed individually), so we can understand sentiment with nuance.
* Future roadmap includes IPFS-based storage for immutable source references, comments sections for public discourse, and economic primitives for community funding.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

| Layer      | Tools                                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend   | React (Gemini prompts), Tailwind, Vite (or Next.js TBD)       |
| Identity   | [Self.xyz](https://self.xyz) for zk-verified but anonymous ID |
| Privacy    | MACI + Semaphore (Ethereum PSE)                               |
| Blockchain | Ethereum-compatible chain (Base, Filecoin optional, Lisk TBD) |
| Storage    | IPFS + Filecoin (exploring integration)                       |
| Dev Tools  | Cline (AI dev agent), GitHub, REPL.it                         |

## üèÜ Bounties Considered

* ENS (Crecimiento) ‚Äî Real-world impact, Ethereum-aligned ‚úÖ
* Zama ‚Äî Confidential governance (stretch goal, pending complexity)
* Filecoin ‚Äî Immutable records of votes, sources, and comments (pending Synapse SDK integration)
* Base ‚Äî Rejected mini-app strategy in favor of full privacy model, but may integrate later for top-of-funnel
* Lisk ‚Äî TBD, contingent on deployment compatibility

## ‚ù§Ô∏è This is Just the Beginning

We're not optimizing for prizes. We're optimizing for permanence.
This repo will outlive the hackathon. The movement will outlive us.
